Run a macro,"There are several different ways you can run a macro, such as using a shortcut key, graphic object, Quick Access Toolbar, a button, or even when opening a workbook."
Copy a macro module to another workbook,"If a workbook contains a VBA macro that you would like to use elsewhere, you can copy the module that contains that macro to another open workbook by using the Microsoft Visual Basic Editor."
"Assign a macro to an object, shape or graphic","On a worksheet, right-click the object, graphic, shape, or the item to which you want to assign an existing macro, and then click Assign Macro.    In the Assign Macro box, click the macro that you want to assign."
