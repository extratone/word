# Copy a macro module to another workbook

There are several different ways you can run a macro, such as using a shortcut key, graphic object, Quick Access Toolbar, a button, or even when opening a workbook.: If a workbook contains a VBA macro that you would like to use elsewhere, you can copy the module that contains that macro to another open workbook by using the Microsoft Visual Basic Editor.
