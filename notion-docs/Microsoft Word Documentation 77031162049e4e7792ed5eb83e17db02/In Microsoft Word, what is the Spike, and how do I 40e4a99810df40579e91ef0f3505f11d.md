The Spike is an extended clipboard feature of Microsoft Word. It allows you to remove two or more items (such as text or graphics) from nonadjacent locations in a Word document, and then insert the items as a group in a new location or document. The items remain in the Spike so you can insert them repeatedly. To add a different set of items to the Spike, you must first empty the Spike's contents.

To move items to and from the Spike:

1. Select the text or graphic you want to move, and then press `Ctrl-F3` (in Windows) or `Command-F3` (on a Mac).
2. Repeat this step for each additional item you want to move to the Spike.
3. Click in the document where you want to insert the Spike's contents.
4. To insert the Spike's contents and empty the Spike, press `Ctrl-Shift-F3` (in Windows) or `Command-Shift-F3` (on a Mac).
