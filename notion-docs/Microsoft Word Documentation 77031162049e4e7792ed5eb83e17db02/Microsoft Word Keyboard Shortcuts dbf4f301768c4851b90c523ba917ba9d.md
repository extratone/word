### Close a task pane

To close a task pane using the keyboard:

1. Press F6 until the task pane is selected.
2. Press Ctrl+Spacebar.

## Ribbon keyboard shortcuts

The ribbon groups related options on tabs. For example, on the **Home** tab, the **Font** group includes the **Font Color** option. Press the Alt key to display the ribbon shortcuts, called Key Tips, as letters in small images next to the tabs and options as shown in the image below.

**Note:** Add-ins and other programs may add new tabs to the ribbon and may provide access keys for those tabs.

You can combine the Key Tips letters with the Alt key to make shortcuts called Access Keys for the ribbon options. For example, press Alt+H to open the **Home** tab, and Alt+Q to move to the **Tell me** or **Search** field. Press Alt again to see Key Tips for the options for the selected tab.

In Office 2013 and Office 2010, most of the old Alt key menu shortcuts still work, too. However, you need to know the full shortcut. For example, press Alt, and then press one of the old menu keys E (Edit), V (View), I (Insert), and so on. A notification pops up saying you're using an access key from an earlier version of Microsoft Office. If you know the entire key sequence, go ahead and use it. If you don't know the sequence, press Esc and use Key Tips instead.

To go directly to a tab on the ribbon, press one of the following access keys. Additional tabs may appear depending on your selection in the document.

**Open the View tab to choose a document view or mode, such as Read Mode or Outline view. You can also set the zoom magnification and manage multiple document windows.**

### Set the proofing language

Every document has a default language, typically the same default language as your computer's operating system. If your document also contains words or phrases in a different language, it's a good idea to set the proofing language for those words. This not only makes it possible to check spelling and grammar for those phrases, it enables assistive technologies like screen readers to handle them appropriately.

### Insert international characters

To type a lowercase character by using a key combination that includes the Shift key, hold down the Ctrl+Shift+symbol keys simultaneously, and then release them before you type the letter.

### Use Input Method Editors for East Asian languages

## Work with document views

Word offers several different views of a document. Each view makes it easier to do certain tasks. For example, **Read Mode** enables you view the document as a horizontal sequence of pages, which you can quickly browse using the Left and Right arrow keys.

### Switch the document view

### Outline a document

These shortcuts only apply when the document is in the **Outline** view.
